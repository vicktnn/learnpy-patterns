# Python CLI Pattern Maker

Hello, this is my first project that I've published to github. This project is merely a simple Python project for learning purposes. This is a Python CLI Pattern Maker. In this very simple app you'll be prompted with several interfaces that will ask you for which pattern you're going to make, the size, and any other data related to the pattern.

## Prerequisites

In order to be able to use this app you must have Python 3 interpreter installed in your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can refer to the [python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads).

## How to start the app?

To start the app you can just `cd` into the directory where you store this app, then type `python main.py` or `py main.py` for Windows in the terminal. Then you should see the main menu interface appears on the command line.

## Create a rectangle

To create a rectangle, type one of this option in the main menu:

-   `rectangle`
-   `rect`
-   `r`

Then you'll be prompted for the width and height of the rectangle. After you enter both of them, you should see the rectangle with your desired size appears on the command line.

## Create a triangle

To create a triangle, type one of this option in the main menu:

-   `triangle`
-   `tri`
-   `t`

Then you'll be prompted for the type of triangle you're going to make.

### Equilateral triangle

To create an equilateral triangle, type one of this option in the triangle type selection menu:

-   `equilateral`
-   `equi`
-   `equal`
-   `eq`
-   `e`

Then you'll be prompted for the size of the triangle you're going to make. This size means both of width and height. After this, you should see the equilateral triangle with your desired size appears on the command line.

### Right triangle

To create a right triangle, type one of this option in the triangle type selection menu:

-   `right`
-   `r`

Then you'll be prompted for the size of the triangle you're going to make. This size means both of width and height. After this, you should see the right triangle with your desired size appears on the command line.

## Create a circle

To create a circle, type one of this option in the main menu:

-   `circle`
-   `circ`
-   `c`

Then you'll be prompted for the diameter of the circle you're going to make. After you entered the diameter, you should see the circle with your desired diameter appears on the command line.

## How to quit the app?

To quit the app, type one of this option in the main menu:

-   `quit`
-   `q`

## How to go back to the main menu?

By any chance, sometimes you might want to go back to main menu. Either you misstype some of the input, or you just want to quit in the middle of the program.

To do this, you can simply press `Ctrl + C` in the keyboard. And you'll be redirected to the main menu. You can then select another option or decided to quit the app with `quit` or `q` option.
